Where the UNSEEN PROXY build stands across the §34 deployment phases.

## Phase tracker

| Phase | Title | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Clean-VPS verification (gate before any build) | DONE (gate passed) |
| 1 | Documentation, repo & architecture planning | DONE (pushed to origin/main, 25e5ddc) |
| 2 | Hiddify test node setup | **RE-SCOPED to a separate DE VPS** (`de1`, `5.249.160.59`, Ubuntu 22.04, planned/test). Master-co-location preflight done then RETIRED. Forward plan: PHASE2_3_DE_NODE_PLAN.md |
| 3 | Hiddify API & subscription compatibility audit | **PARTIAL — Docker-on-Master proven non-viable & torn down; API contract still unverified.** Decision (ADR-001): DE → supported host install on a separate Ubuntu-22.04 VPS. Live-verify to be re-done on `de1`. See PHASE3_HIDDIFY_LIVE_VERIFY.md |
| 4 | Database & backend clone design | PENDING |
| 5 | Telegram bot implementation (Burmese-primary) | PENDING |
| 6 | Hiddify subscription delivery integration | PENDING |
| 7 | Plan-based region/protocol entitlement + node resilience | PENDING |
| 8 | Web app / customer portal | PENDING |
| 9 | Messenger and Viber bot integration | PENDING |
| 10 | Monitoring, backup, security, production hardening | PENDING |
| 11 | Internal beta testing | PENDING |
| 12 | Controlled public soft launch | PENDING |

## Next up

**Architecture (current):** the **Master is control-plane only** — co-location is **retired**
([DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) ADR-001). The Master was tested as a co-located DE node via Hiddify's experimental
Docker (v12.3.3); the panel was non-functional (compose `$REDIS_PASSWORD` bug + DB migration errors), so it was torn
down and the Master returned to baseline (SSH up, 80/443 free, Docker engine left installed but unused — a **cleanup
candidate** per [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) ADR-003, to be removed in a future audited "Master cleanup" task).

**DE node is now a dedicated separate VPS:** `de1`, `5.249.160.59`, 4 vCPU / 4 GB / 25 GB SSD / 30 TB, **Ubuntu
22.04 LTS**, `status=test`, domain `node-de.unseen.click` — managed from the Master only, proxy traffic only.
These specs are **provider estimates (unverified)**; per [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) ADR-002 the Master detects the
node's real facts (read-only) at preflight and those override the estimates.

**SSH key prepared (2026-06-15):** a dedicated Master→`de1` ed25519 keypair exists at
`/root/.ssh/unseenproxy_de1_ed25519` (private `600`, root-only) / `.pub` (`644`), comment `unseen-proxy-master-to-de1`,
fingerprint `SHA256:jUYAdY0ONdXKzOg2s4OKO27yBGqLvBwapkEy25oA3+I`.

**SSH connectivity test (2026-06-15) — PARTIAL / HOLD.** `de1` is **reachable** (TCP/22 open, SSH handshake OK, host
key pinned in `known_hosts`), but the Master key is **not yet authorized**: both `root@5.249.160.59` and
`ubuntu@5.249.160.59` return `Permission denied (publickey)`. The provider-panel key add hasn't taken effect for
either user. **Charles must install the public key on `de1`** via the provider console/terminal (fallback command in
CHANGELOG / below), then we re-test. No node changes made; password login not attempted.

**Next task — Phase 2-DE / 3-DE** (see [PHASE2_3_DE_NODE_PLAN.md](PHASE2_3_DE_NODE_PLAN.md)): clean-VPS preflight on
`de1` (verify 22.04, no legacy, ports/firewall/resources, DNS plan), Master→node SSH key setup, then Hiddify's
**supported host install**, live Swagger/API-contract verification, one disposable test user, and FAST1/FAST2/Secure
inbound checks. **No connection to the node yet** — that's the next authorized task. **Phase 4 stays blocked** until
the DE node yields a verified-live API contract.
